        <h1>The Italian Renaissance</h1>
        <p>
            The Renaissance was a period of cultural rebirth that began in Italy during the 14th century and gradually spread throughout Europe. It marked a renewed interest in classical learning, art, and philosophy inspired by ancient Greece and Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike the medieval period that preceded it, the Renaissance emphasized human potential, creativity, and individual achievement. Thinkers and artists began to focus on realism, perspective, and the natural world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cities like Florence became centers of innovation, supported by wealthy patrons who funded artists, architects, and scholars. This financial support allowed creativity and scientific thinking to flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideas developed during the Renaissance laid the foundation for modern science, politics, and education, making it one of the most influential periods in human history.
